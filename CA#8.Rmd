Simpson's paradox is when two variables have either a positive or negative relationship, but when a third variable is introduced that initial relationship either disappears or is reversed. In the text book they use the example of how debt and income have a positive relationship until the variable of credit_limit, where their relationship then becomes a negative relationship.

"Simpsonâ€™s paradox arises when there are hidden variables that split data into multiple separate distributions."(towardsdatascience)

I viewed numerous examples ranging from the UC-Berkley acceptance rates to declining wage of the U.S. So I figured I would add my own example.

Let's say we want to see if there is a difference 






So, when analyzing data it all boils down to how your data is grouped.
